I’m **Junwen Miao**, an enthusiastic and motivated software engineering student with a passion for tackling challenges through innovation and collaboration. Inspired by **Taylor Swift**'s resilience and determination, I aspire to be as strong, hardworking, and steadfast in pursuing my goals.

Currently, I am focused on **deep learning**, **computer vision**, **LLMs** and **diffusion models**, with research experience in fields ranging from injury severity assessment using LLMs to depth completion with diffusion models. I am deeply interested in how technology can empower people and bring creative solutions to complex problems.

Feel free to connect if you'd like to discuss ideas or collaborate on exciting projects! **Let's innovate together!** 🚀
